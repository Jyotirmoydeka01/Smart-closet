# Smart-closet
The Smart Closet Light Control project leverages an Arduino microcontroller and an infrared (IR) sensor to automatically manage lighting in a closet. This system activates the light when the closet door is opened and turns it off when the door is closed, providing convenience and energy efficiency.
